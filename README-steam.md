[h1]Additional Combat Details (non-intrusive)[/h1]

*This addon is work in progress. See features below.*

This addon provides a compact, non-intrusive display of detailed combat information.

The display is intentionally lightweight and lives in the log area so it complements existing UI and other addons while giving a clearer, turn-by-turn narrative of what happened during combat.
