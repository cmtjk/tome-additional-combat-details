# Additional Combat Details (non-intrusive)

*This addon is work in progress. See features below.*

This addon provides a compact, non-intrusive display of detailed combat information.

The display is intentionally lightweight and lives in the log area so it complements existing UI and other addons while giving a clearer, turn-by-turn narrative of what happened during combat.

**Features:**
- Shows to-hit-chance for players and enemies: `(50 + 2,5 * ( attacker_accuracy - defender_defense))`
